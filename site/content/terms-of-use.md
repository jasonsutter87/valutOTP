# Terms of Service

**Last updated: December 2024**

## Agreement to Terms

By downloading, installing, or using VaultOTP ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.

## Description of Service

VaultOTP is a two-factor authentication (2FA) application that generates time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) for your online accounts. The App allows you to:

- Store and generate 2FA codes
- Organize accounts into folders
- Import accounts from other authenticator apps
- Export accounts for backup purposes

## License

We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for personal or business purposes in accordance with these Terms.

## Your Responsibilities

You are responsible for:

- **Securing your device**: The App stores your 2FA secrets on your device. If someone gains access to your device, they may access your codes.
- **Backing up your data**: Since all data is stored locally, if you lose your device or uninstall the App without exporting your accounts, your data will be lost. We cannot recover it.
- **Maintaining access to your accounts**: VaultOTP is one component of your account security. Ensure you have backup access methods for your online accounts.

## Disclaimer of Warranties

THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:

- MERCHANTABILITY
- FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
- NON-INFRINGEMENT
- ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY

We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or completely secure.

## Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL VAULTOTP, ITS DEVELOPERS, OR AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR ANY:

- Indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages
- Loss of profits, data, use, or goodwill
- Account lockouts resulting from lost or inaccessible 2FA codes
- Damages arising from your use or inability to use the App

This limitation applies regardless of the legal theory (contract, tort, or otherwise) and even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

## Security

While we implement industry-standard encryption using your device's secure storage (iOS Keychain / Android Keystore), no security measure is perfect. You acknowledge that:

- You use the App at your own risk
- You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device
- We are not liable for unauthorized access to your data resulting from device compromise

## Intellectual Property

The App, including its code, design, and branding, is owned by VaultOTP and protected by intellectual property laws. You may not:

- Copy, modify, or distribute the App
- Reverse engineer or decompile the App
- Use our trademarks without permission

## Third-Party Services

VaultOTP does not integrate with third-party services. However, the 2FA codes you generate are used with third-party websites and services. We are not responsible for:

- The security or availability of those third-party services
- Any issues arising from your use of 2FA with those services

## Changes to Terms

We may modify these Terms at any time. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms. We encourage you to review these Terms periodically.

## Termination

You may stop using the App at any time by uninstalling it. We reserve the right to terminate or suspend access to the App for violations of these Terms.

## Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the United States. Any disputes shall be resolved in the courts of the applicable jurisdiction.

## Severability

If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in effect.

## Contact

For questions about these Terms, contact us at:

**Email:** support@vaultotp.app

## Acknowledgment

By using VaultOTP, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service.
