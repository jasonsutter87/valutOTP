# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: December 2024**

## The Short Version

VaultOTP doesn't collect any of your data. Period.

## Overview

VaultOTP ("we", "our", or "the app") is a two-factor authentication (2FA) application designed with privacy as a core feature. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information—or more accurately, how we don't.

## Information We Collect

**None.**

VaultOTP is designed to work entirely offline. We do not:

- Create user accounts
- Collect personal information
- Track your usage or behavior
- Use analytics or tracking tools
- Store any data on external servers
- Share any information with third parties

## How Your Data is Stored

All your 2FA secrets, account names, and folder organization are stored **locally on your device only**. Your data is:

- Encrypted using your device's native secure storage (iOS Keychain / Android Keystore)
- Never transmitted over the internet
- Never accessible to us or anyone else
- Completely under your control

## Data You Provide

When you add accounts to VaultOTP (via QR code scan or manual entry), this information stays on your device. We have no ability to access, view, or retrieve your authentication secrets.

## Third-Party Services

VaultOTP does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The app functions entirely offline.

## Data Export

VaultOTP allows you to export your accounts for backup or migration purposes. When you export:

- The export is generated locally on your device
- No data is sent to any server
- You are responsible for the security of any exported data

## Children's Privacy

VaultOTP does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date above. Since we don't collect your data, we have no way to notify you directly—please check this page periodically.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect or store any of your personal data, there is nothing to access, correct, or delete on our end. All your data is on your device, fully under your control.

## Contact Us

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:

**Email:** support@vaultotp.app

## Summary

We built VaultOTP because we believe privacy is a feature, not an afterthought. Your 2FA secrets are yours alone—we can't see them because we literally have no way to access them.
